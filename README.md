# Heart-Data
This R script is designed to help you explore a dataset related to heart health. It uses various R packages like ggplot2, dplyr, and tidyr to analyze and understand the data.

# Instructions:
### Load Packages:
This script begins by loading essential R packages. These packages provide tools for data visualization and manipulation.
### Loading Dataset:
The script loads a dataset named "heart_failure_clinical_records.csv."(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/heart-failure-prediction) Make sure you have this dataset saved in your specified location. You can replace "~/Downloads/heart_failure_clinical_records.csv" with the correct file path if needed.
### Checking the Dataset:
Three commands are used to examine the dataset:
str(heart) provides the dataset's structure, showing the variables' types.
summary(heart) offers summary statistics for the variables.
glimpse(heart) gives a concise dataset overview, including variable names and the first few rows of data.

# Getting Started:

Make sure you have R installed on your computer. You can download it from R Project.
Open R or an RStudio environment.
Copy and paste the provided code into your R or RStudio console or script editor.
Ensure the dataset "heart_failure_clinical_records.csv" is in the correct location, or update the file path as needed.
Run the script to load the dataset and display its structure and summary statistics.
Explore and analyze the data further using additional R commands and visualizations as needed.
